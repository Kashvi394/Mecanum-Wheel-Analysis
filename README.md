# Mecanum-Wheel-Analysis
A self-initiated project exploring omnidirectional mobility through the design and analysis of a Mecanum wheel.

## Overview
This project explores the fundamental design and applications of Mecanum wheels, which enable omnidirectional movement in robotic platforms. It focuses on the CAD modeling and motion simulation of a single Mecanum wheel, along with a study of its mechanics, kinematics, and real-world use cases.

## Tools Used
- Fusion 360 (CAD modeling and motion joints)
